 UNIST Robot
=====

This is a C# program which sorts and displays the useful information from UNIST web services.

The services contain portal.unist.ac.kr, dorm.unist.ac.kr, bb.unist.ac.kr etc.

The main motivation of this program is that the access to UNIST web services is really uncomfortable and boring.

Currently, this project is closed because of UNIST portal bot.
